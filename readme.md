# Kattis solutions

Here is where I have put all of my solutions for the problems on Kattis.

All of the solutions have been done in java and can be found in the `src` directory.

Any incomplete solutions will be stored on a separate branch. The branch will be the name
of the Kattis problem. Once the problem is solved it is merged into master.
